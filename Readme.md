# Intelligent Traffic Analysis and Vehicle Classification

## Overview
This project implements real-time traffic counting system. It detects, classifies, and counts vehicles from video footage, including local vehicles such as Indian autorickshaws. The system generates structured traffic reports for analysis.

The solution combines pre-trained YOLOv8 models with custom-trained models to support accurate and extensible vehicle detection.
